This project is inspired by the course INFO 526 - Data Analysis and Visualisation taught by Dr. Anna Rose Leach at the University of Arizona. It was part of one of the questions given in Homework 1. 
I am trying to build on the project by adding my learnings around Accessibility and Story Telling.
Main credit would always go to my brilliant professor, who taught me how to tell impactful stories behind the data.
